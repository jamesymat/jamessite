  <h2>Into the Mind of a Cat</h2>
      <h3><p>Interviewer: Please introduce yourself.</p>
      <p>Ragsy: Hi, my name is Ragsy. I am a ragdoll cat. We are known to be large, but I am a little bit bigger than the others. I have been on a diet for my whole life. </p>
      <p>Interviewer: How old are you?</p>
      <p>Ragsy: In human years, I am 9 years old and have been with my family for 8 years now.</p>
      <p>Interviewer: What does a day in your life look like?</p>
      <p>Ragsy: My life mainly consists of eating and sleeping.</p>
      <p>Interviewer: What are your likes and dislikes?</p>
      <p>Ragsy: I love food and people who feed me. I hate cars, loud noises, car rides, other animals, and having to move anywhere away from the food bowl. </p>
      <p>Interviewer: What is your worst fear? </p>
      <p>Ragsy: My worst nightmare is getting stuck in the cat door, again. </p>
      <p>Interviewer: How do you get exercise? </p>
      <p>Ragsy: I prefer to exercise by running to the food bowl or jumping onto the forbidden table.</p></h3>
